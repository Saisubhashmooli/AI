# **Data Science**
Data Science is the current reigning technology that has conquered industries around the world. It has brought about a fourth industrial revolution in the world today.

This a result of the contribution by the massive explosion in data and the growing need of the industries to rely on data to create better products. We have become a part of a data-driven society. Data has become a dire need for industries that need data to make careful decisions.

## **Artificial Intelligence** 
Artificial Intelligence is the intelligence that is possessed by the machines. It is modeled after the natural intelligence that is possessed by animals and humans. Artificial Intelligence makes the use of algorithms to perform autonomous actions.

These autonomous actions are similar to the ones performed in the past which were successful.

Many traditional Artificial Intelligence algorithms were explicitly provided goals, as was in the case of path finding algorithms like A*. However, contemporary AI Algorithms like deep learning understand the patterns and find the goal embedded in the data.

Artificial Intelligence also makes use of several software engineering principles for developing solutions to existing problems.

**Machine Learning** - Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.


## **Deep Learning** 
Deep learning is a machine learning technique that is inspired by the way a human brain filters information, it is basically learning from examples. It helps a computer model to filter the input data through layers to predict and classify information. Since deep learning processes information in a similar manner as a human brain does, it is mostly used in applications that people generally do. It is the key technology behind driver-less cars, that enables them to recognize a stop sign and to distinguish between a pedestrian and lamp post. Most of the deep learning methods use neural network architectures, so they are often referred to as deep neural networks. 

### **ANN** - Artificial neural network 
Artificial neural network (ANN) is a computational model that consists of several processing elements that receive inputs and deliver outputs based on their predefined activation functions


### **CNN** - convolutional neural network
A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a type of artificial neural network used in image recognition and processing that is specifically designed to process pixel data.

CNNs are powerful image processing, artificial intelligence (AI) that use deep learning to perform both generative and descriptive tasks, often using machine vison that includes image and video recognition, along with recommender systems and natural language processing (NLP).

### **VGG** - Visual Geometry Group
VGG stands for Visual Geometry Group; it is a standard deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture with multiple layers. VGG-16 or VGG-19 consisting of 16 and 19 convolutional layers.

The VGG architecture is the basis of ground-breaking object recognition models. Developed as a deep neural network, the VGGNet also surpasses baselines on many tasks and datasets beyond ImageNet. Moreover, it is now still one of the most popular image recognition architectures.

### **RNN** - recurrent neural network 
A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a type of artificial neural network which uses sequential data or time series data. These deep learning algorithms are commonly used for ordinal or temporal problems, such as language translation, natural language processing (nlp), speech recognition, and image captioning; they are incorporated into popular applications such as Siri, voice search, and Google Translate. Like feedforward and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks utilize training data to learn. 

### **NLP** - Natural language processing 
Natural language processing strives to build machines that understand and respond to text or voice data—and respond with text or speech of their own—in much the same way humans do.

Natural language processing (NLP) refers to the branch of computer science—and more specifically, the branch of artificial intelligence or AI—concerned with giving computers the ability to understand text and spoken words in much the same way human beings can.

## **Tensorflow** 
TensorFlow is an open-source end-to-end platform for creating Machine Learning applications. It is a symbolic math library that uses dataflow and differentiable programming to perform various tasks focused on training and inference of deep neural networks. It allows developers to create machine learning applications using various tools, libraries, and community resources.

Currently, the most famous deep learning library in the world is Google’s TensorFlow. Google product uses machine learning in all of its products to improve the search engine, translation, image captioning or recommendations.

## **Pytorch**
PyTorch is an open source machine learning (ML) framework based on the Python programming language and the Torch library. It is one of the preferred platforms for deep learning research. The framework is built to speed up the process between research prototyping and deployment.

## **OpenCV** - Open-Source Computer Vision
OpenCV stands for Open-Source Computer Vision (Library). It is the most commonly used, popular, and well-documented Computer Vision library. It is open-source, which means that one does not require a license to utilize the software
