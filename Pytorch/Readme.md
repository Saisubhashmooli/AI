# **Pytorch**
PyTorch is an open source machine learning (ML) framework based on the Python programming language and the Torch library. It is one of the preferred platforms for deep learning research. The framework is built to speed up the process between research prototyping and deployment.

# **OpenCV** - Open-Source Computer Vision
OpenCV stands for Open-Source Computer Vision (Library). It is the most commonly used, popular, and well-documented Computer Vision library. It is open-source, which means that one does not require a license to utilize the software

# **NLP** - Natural language processing
Natural language processing strives to build machines that understand and respond to text or voice data—and respond with text or speech of their own—in much the same way humans do.

Natural language processing (NLP) refers to the branch of computer science—and more specifically, the branch of artificial intelligence or AI—concerned with giving computers the ability to understand text and spoken words in much the same way human beings can.
